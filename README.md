# ML MNIST Challenge
This contest was offered within TU Munich's course Machine Learning 1 (IN2064).<br>
The goal was to implement k-NN, Neural Network, Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process Classifier in 
python from scratch and achieve minimal average test error among these classifiers on well-known MNIST dataset, 
without ensemble learning.

## Results
TODO table
Check `report/` for report and some plots.

## How to install
```
git clone https://github.com/monsta-hd/ml-mnist
cd ml-mnist/
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
make test
```

## How to run
Check `main.py` to reproduce training and testing the final models.<br>
Check `cross_validations.ipynb` to see what I've tried, cross-validations etc.<br>

## System
All computations and time measurements were made on laptop `i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz x 4` `12GB RAM`

## Future work
